Within the last couple of years, this field has gained increasing research interest varying from simple linear models to more complex neural networks models. Several challenges including the grammar, structures of the language and Morphology which one-word lead to many important meanings. The varieties of dialects and the lack of the appropriate corpora limit the use of sentiment analysis on Arabic content. Throughout this paper, we aim at providing a review on the utilization of the deep learning (DL) approach to analyze sentiments expressed in the Arabic text by using Multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. The results show that the MLP model shows highly effective performance in sentiment analysis for both Arabic and English languages.},

  abstract = {Sentiment analysis has become a highly effective research field in the natural language domain and has a large scope of real-world implementations. An existing active study concentration for sentiment analysis is the development of graininess at the document level, appearing with two featured objectives: subjectivity classification, which determines whether a document is objective or subjective and sentiment detection which defines whether or not a document has a sentiment. Deep learning approaches have featured as a chance for developing these objectives with their ability to present both syntactic and semantic characteristics of text without demands for high-level attribute engineering. In this paper, we focus to produce a systematic literature review of deep learning methods for document-based sentiment analysis to determine different features in the text. In addition, this systematic literature review presents a brief survey, evaluation, enhancement of recent developments in the field of sentiment analysis techniques and applications of documents for deep learning, starting with the Convolutional Neural Network, continues to cover the Recurrent Neural Network, including Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Repetitive Units. This review also contains the implementation and application of Recursive Neural Network, Deep Belief Network, Domain-Adversarial Network Models and Hybrid Neural Network. This work considers most of the papers published when the history of deep learning began, and specifically the sentiment analysis of the documents.}

This writer generated sentiment content can be about books, people, hotels, products, research, events, etc. These sentiments become very beneficial for businesses, governments, and individuals. While this content is meant to be useful, a bulk of this writer generated content require using the text mining techniques and sentiment analysis. But there are several challenges facing the sentiment analysis and evaluation process. These challenges become obstacles in analyzing the accurate meaning of sentiments and detecting the suitable sentiment polarity. Sentiment analysis is the practice of applying natural language processing and text analysis techniques to identify and extract subjective information from text. This paper presents a survey on the sentiment analysis challenges relevant to their approaches and techniques.},

  abstract = {<p>There is a need to extract meaningful information from big data, classify it into different categories, and predict end-user behavior or emotions. Large amounts of data are generated from various sources such as social media and websites. Text classification is a representative research topic in the field of natural-language processing that categorizes unstructured text data into meaningful categorical classes. The long short-term memory (LSTM) model and the convolutional neural network for sentence classification produce accurate results and have been recently used in various natural-language processing (NLP) tasks. Convolutional neural network (CNN) models use convolutional layers and maximum pooling or max-overtime pooling layers to extract higher-level features, while LSTM models can capture long-term dependencies between word sequences hence are better used for text classification. However, even with the hybrid approach that leverages the powers of these two deep-learning models, the number of features to remember for classification remains huge, hence hindering the training process. In this study, we propose an attention-based Bi-LSTM+CNN hybrid model that capitalize on the advantages of LSTM and CNN with an additional attention mechanism. We trained the model using the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) movie review data to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, and the test results showed that the proposed hybrid attention Bi-LSTM+CNN model produces more accurate classification results, as well as higher recall and F1 scores, than individual multi-layer perceptron (MLP), CNN or LSTM models as well as the hybrid models.</p>},

  abstract  = {The development of IoT technologies and the massive admiration and acceptance of social media tools and applications, new doors of opportunity have been opened for using data analytics in gaining meaningful insights from unstructured information. The application of opinion mining and sentiment analysis (OMSA) in the era of big data have been used a useful way in categorizing the opinion into different sentiment and in general evaluating the mood of the public. Moreover, different techniques of OMSA have been developed over the years in different data sets and applied to various experimental settings. In this regard, this paper presents a comprehensive systematic literature review, aims to discuss both technical aspect of OMSA (techniques and types) and non-technical aspect in the form of application areas are discussed. Furthermore, this paper also highlighted both technical aspects of OMSA in the form of challenges in the development of its technique and non-technical challenges mainly based on its application. These challenges are presented as a future direction for research.},

It is among the basic text pre-processing approaches used in Language Modeling, Natural Language Processing, and Information Retrieval applications. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey of text stemming techniques, evaluation mechanisms, and application domains. The main objective of this survey is to distill the main insights and present a detailed assessment of the current state of the art. The performance of some well-known rule-based and statistical stemming algorithms in different scenarios has been analyzed. In the end, we highlighted some open issues and challenges related to unsupervised statistical text stemming. This research work will help the researchers to select the most suitable text stemming technique in a specific application and will also serve as a guide to identify the areas that need attention from the research community.</p>},

  abstract = {Preprocessing is one of the key components in a typical text classification framework. This paper aims to extensively examine the impact of preprocessing on text classification in terms of various aspects such as classification accuracy, text domain, text language, and dimension reduction. For this purpose, all possible combinations of widely used preprocessing tasks are comparatively evaluated on two different domains, namely e-mail and news, and in two different languages, namely Turkish and English. In this way, contribution of the preprocessing tasks to classification success at various feature dimensions, possible interactions among these tasks, and also dependency of these tasks to the respective languages and domains are comprehensively assessed. Experimental analysis on benchmark datasets reveals that choosing appropriate combinations of preprocessing tasks, rather than enabling or disabling them all, may provide significant improvement on classification accuracy depending on the domain and language studied on.},

In response, we introduce the first-ever vast resource for the training, evaluating, and benchmarking on Indonesian natural language understanding (IndoNLU) tasks. IndoNLU includes twelve tasks, ranging from single sentence classification to pair-sentences sequence labeling with different levels of complexity. The datasets for the tasks lie in different domains and styles to ensure task diversity. We also provide a set of Indonesian pre-trained models (IndoBERT) trained from a large and clean Indonesian dataset Indo4B collected from publicly available sources such as social media texts, blogs, news, and websites. We release baseline models for all twelve tasks, as well as the framework for benchmark evaluation, and thus it enables everyone to benchmark their system performances.},

The experiment shows that the accuracy of CNN-BiLSTM model associated with Word2vec word embedding achieved 91.48%. This proves that the hybrid network model performs better than the single structure neural network in short text.},
